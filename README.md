The front-end for the XSOV (xsovxsovxsov) contract.  XSOV is a token pegged to SOV which only grows in SOV value, similar to REX. Minting XSOV takes a 1% fee that is distributed to other XSOV holders, via increasing the SOV amount backing XSOV. XSOV can be destroyed to release SOV with zero fee. Note that SOV burn rate will still be in effect.
